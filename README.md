# Wavelet-Transform-1D

•	Project: 1D (Audio) Haar Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and then the 1D Inverse DWT

•	Synopsis: 
Although this program can be run on the desktop PC, it is optimized for DSP Processors and has actually been ported to an embedded DSP platform; thus, in order to manage memory efficiently, NO scratch arrays were used: the transforms are done in-place. Although this is a C++ program, the use of classes, the bool variable type and advanced C++ features have intentionally been omitted for easier porting to embedded (ANSI) C. For the same reason, recursive algorithms have been avoided. 

•	Programming Languages and IDEs: 
a)	C and C++
b)	MATLAB
c)	Net Beans IDE

•	How to use:
The sample audio array length must be dyadic in dimension. If it does not meet these criteria, it should be padded to the nearest power of two.
